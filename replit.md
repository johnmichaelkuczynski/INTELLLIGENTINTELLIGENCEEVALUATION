# Cognitive Analysis Platform

## Overview
This platform analyzes written text to assess the intelligence and cognitive fingerprint of authors using multi-model AI evaluation. It offers document analysis, AI detection, translation, and comprehensive cognitive profiling. The project aims to provide deep insights into cognitive abilities and thought processes from written content. **MAJOR CHANGE**: All rewrite functionality has been completely removed from the platform as per user decision to focus purely on analysis capabilities.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application is structured as a monorepo, separating client and server components.
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, wouter for routing, React Query for server state, and Chart.js for data visualization.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, integrating multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity AI, DeepSeek), document processing via Mathpix OCR, and speech-to-text with AssemblyAI. Email services are handled by SendGrid.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, storing user, document, analysis, cognitive profile, and rewrite history data.
- **Core Services**: Includes multi-model intelligence evaluation, document comparison, multi-language translation, and OCR for mathematical notation.
- **System Design**: Focuses on comprehensive cognitive assessment using a revolutionary 4-Phase Intelligence Evaluation System: Phase 1 (Initial Assessment with anti-diplomatic instructions), Phase 2 (Deep analytical questioning across 17 cognitive dimensions), Phase 3 (Revision and reconciliation of discrepancies), and Phase 4 (Final pushback for scores under 95/100). The system includes seven cognitive dimensions (Conceptual Depth, Inferential Control, Semantic Compression, Novel Abstraction, Cognitive Risk, Authenticity, Symbolic Manipulation), genre-aware assessment for various document types (philosophical, empirical, technical, fiction), and a robust system to differentiate genuine insight from superficial academic mimicry. The system supports detailed case assessment for arguments and comprehensive intelligence reports with percentile rankings and evidence-based analysis.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes shadcn/ui for components, TailwindCSS for styling, and provides detailed card-based layouts for analysis reports, supporting PDF and text downloads.

## External Dependencies
- **AI Service Providers**: OpenAI API (GPT-4), Anthropic API (Claude), Perplexity AI, DeepSeek API.
- **Supporting Services**: Mathpix OCR, AssemblyAI, SendGrid, Google Custom Search.
- **Database & Infrastructure**: Neon/PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Replit (hosting and development environment).
