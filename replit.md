# Cognitive Analysis Platform

## Overview
This platform analyzes written text to assess the intelligence and cognitive fingerprint of authors using multi-model AI evaluation. It offers document analysis, AI detection, text rewriting, translation, and comprehensive cognitive profiling. The project aims to provide deep insights into cognitive abilities and thought processes from written content.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application is structured as a monorepo, separating client and server components.
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, wouter for routing, React Query for server state, and Chart.js for data visualization.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, integrating multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity AI, DeepSeek), document processing via Mathpix OCR, and speech-to-text with AssemblyAI. Email services are handled by SendGrid.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, storing user, document, analysis, cognitive profile, and rewrite history data.
- **Core Services**: Includes multi-model intelligence evaluation, document comparison, AI-powered text rewriting, multi-language translation, and OCR for mathematical notation.
- **System Design**: Focuses on comprehensive cognitive assessment using a revolutionary 4-Phase Intelligence Evaluation System: Phase 1 (Initial Assessment with anti-diplomatic instructions), Phase 2 (Deep analytical questioning across 17 cognitive dimensions), Phase 3 (Revision and reconciliation of discrepancies), and Phase 4 (Final pushback for scores under 95/100). The system includes seven cognitive dimensions (Conceptual Depth, Inferential Control, Semantic Compression, Novel Abstraction, Cognitive Risk, Authenticity, Symbolic Manipulation), genre-aware assessment for various document types (philosophical, empirical, technical, fiction), and a robust system to differentiate genuine insight from superficial academic mimicry. The system supports detailed case assessment for arguments and comprehensive intelligence reports with percentile rankings and evidence-based analysis.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes shadcn/ui for components, TailwindCSS for styling, and provides detailed card-based layouts for analysis reports, supporting PDF and text downloads.

## External Dependencies

- **Supporting Services**: Mathpix OCR, AssemblyAI, SendGrid, Google Custom Search.
- **Database & Infrastructure**: Neon/PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Replit (hosting and development environment).

## Recent Progress Updates
- **August 18, 2025**: Successfully implemented comprehensive 4-Phase Intelligence Evaluation System
  - **Phase 1**: Initial assessment with strict anti-diplomatic instructions to prevent academic grading bias
  - **Phase 2**: Deep analytical questioning across 17 cognitive dimensions (insight, development, organization, logic, freshness, precision, authenticity, etc.)
  - **Phase 3**: Revision and reconciliation process to resolve discrepancies between initial and analytical assessments
  - **Phase 4**: Final pushback challenge for scores under 95/100 with percentile awareness ("Your position is that X out of 100 outperform the author...")
  - **System Status**: OPERATIONAL - All LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, DeepSeek) successfully using new evaluation framework
  - **Performance**: Evaluations taking 60-90 seconds per provider due to comprehensive multi-phase analysis
  - **User Feedback**: "EXCELLENT. MUCH BETTER. MUCH MUCH BETTER." - System meeting requirements for sophisticated intelligence assessment
  - **Architecture Impact**: Replaced simple pushback mechanism with sophisticated multi-call evaluation process that forces LLMs to drop diplomatic hedging and assess pure cognitive capacity
  - **August 18, 2025 - CRITICAL SUCCESS**: Ultra-aggressive pushback system implemented and tested successfully
    - **Test Result**: DeepSeek analysis achieved 99/100 score (well above required 96/100 minimum)
    - **System Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL - All garbage dimensions eliminated, pure 3-phase protocol working perfectly
    - **Performance**: Phase 2 ultra-aggressive pushback successfully elevated scores from 85 to 99/100
    - **User Requirements Met**: DeepSeek as default, no filtering, exact protocol implementation, high scores achieved
  - **August 18, 2025 - CORRECTED SYSTEM**: Fixed score inflation issue - system now properly evaluates quality
    - **Issue Fixed**: Removed aggressive pushback that was inflating all scores to 98/100 regardless of quality  
    - **Test Result**: Low-quality text correctly scored 5/100 (not inflated to 98/100)
    - **System Status**: PROPERLY OPERATIONAL - Accurate discrimination between high and low quality content
    - **Protocol**: Pure 3-phase implementation without garbage score inflation
  - **August 18, 2025 - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: System fully operational with proper UI and enhanced evaluation
    - **UI Fixed**: Detailed analysis reports now display properly in comparison view (no more blank content)
    - **Evaluation Enhanced**: Improved prompts to better detect genuine vs. phony reasoning and canned academic mimicry
    - **Score Range**: System properly scores from 40/100 (low quality) to 92/100+ (high quality) with appropriate discrimination
    - **User Confirmation**: "MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER. NOTE PROGRESS!!!!!!" - All major issues resolved
    - **System Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL - Proper evaluation, scoring, and UI display working correctly
  - **August 18, 2025 - TWO DOCUMENT MODE PERFECTED**: Fixed final UI issue for dual document comparison
    - **Issue Resolved**: Both Document A and Document B reports now display properly (no more blank first document)
    - **Fix Applied**: Added analysis field to ensure UI compatibility without changing evaluation logic
    - **Test Results**: System showing proper score discrimination (50/100 vs 95/100) with full detailed reports for both documents
    - **User Confirmation**: "THIS IS GOOD. IT IS WORKING WELL. NOTE PROGRESS." - Two document mode fully operational
