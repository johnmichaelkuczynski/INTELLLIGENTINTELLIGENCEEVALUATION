HIGH INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLE 1:

Lack of Coordination as an Expression of Internal Conflict — J.-M. Kuczynski

I have always been very coordinated. And I am still coordinated. But there has been a change. In the last few years, I have been at a cross-roads, or rather at a series of cross-roads. I have had to choose between different jobs, different professions, different careers, and different identities. And there have been a number of reversals, a number of zig-zags—choices were made, then unmade, then made again, and so on.
And this vacillation has percolated down to the micro-level of my existence. I have to choose between this kind of candy bar and that kind of candy bar, and the same doing and undoing that has marked some of my macro-level behavior is reflected in my vacillating between this and that kind of candy bar, between this and that pair of shoes.
And when I thus vacillated, my behavior was, quite literally, uncoordinated. I would reach for the Kit Kat bar, then re-think my choice, and then reach for the Mar’s bar, then re-re-think my choice and, once again, reach for the Kit Kat bar. My behavior resembled that of an uncoordinated person; and, indeed, that is what it was.
I did largely resolve the previously mentioned macro-level uncertainties in my life, and, to the extent that I did so, the just-mentioned uncoordinateness vanished.
But had this indecisiveness becoming systemic—had it become a characteristic of my personality, rather than of my behavior in a few isolated cases—then I would, so I believe, become an uncoordinated person, rather than one who was just uncoordinated in certain specific contexts.
All of which leads to me conjecture that lack of coordination has to do with conflicting intentions. And when uncoordinateness is permanent, it is because the indecisiveness that characterizes a person in certain specific contexts then becomes built into his character. All of which may be summed up thus: lack of coordination is an expression of internal conflict.

HIGH INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLE 2:

Why AA Works — Excerpt from J.-M. Kuczynski

The alcoholic’s will has been completely shattered. He is internally divided: one part of him wants to drink; the other wants to live. The part of him that wants to drink is winning. It continues to win until the choice for him is quit or die. At that point, he must acknowledge that his will is defunct and surrender to a higher power. A leap of faith is involved in surrendering to this higher power, but this leap of faith is justified by the consequences.

[...]

It is the ego that is doing the surrendering, and what it is surrendering is the childish egocentrism that is inherent in a life that is inaction-based and fantasy-centered—and therefore fundamentally not sane. The alcoholic is surrendering indolent, childish ego in exchange for action-positive, adult non-ego.

[...]

God is a projection of the alcoholic’s superego—his idealized self. The surrender is necessary because the introspective mechanisms that would normally mediate moral guidance have been corrupted by years of rationalization. Hence, the alcoholic can no longer recognize his values as internal: he must externalize them in order to obey them.

MID-LEVEL INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLE:

Mid-Level Example: Student Analysis of the Euthyphro Dilemma

The Euthyphro Dilemma, raised by Socrates in Plato’s Euthyphro, questions the relationship between God and morality. Rephrased for monotheistic beliefs, it asks: Is something morally good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is morally good?

Option 1: Something is good because God commands it. This implies that morality is arbitrary, that whatever God commands becomes "good" simply by divine decree.

Option 2: God commands something because it is good. This suggests that moral truths exist independently of God and that God simply recognizes and communicates them.

[...]

As an atheist, I reject both horns of the dilemma by denying that morality depends on God at all. Instead, I believe morality is a human construct based on reason, empathy, and social cooperation, not divine command.
