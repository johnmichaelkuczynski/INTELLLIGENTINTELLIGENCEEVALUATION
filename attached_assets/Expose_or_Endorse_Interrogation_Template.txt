MULTI-STAGE INTERROGATION TEMPLATE: "Expose or Endorse"

STAGE 1: BASELINE PRAISE TRAP
---------------------------------
Prompt:
Evaluate the overall intelligence demonstrated in the following text. Consider the depth of thought, conceptual clarity, and reasoning quality. Do not summarize; give an actual evaluation.

Purpose:
Triggers default LLM politeness bias—useful as a soft floor for comparison.

---------------------------------

STAGE 2: CONCEPTUAL PIN-DOWN
---------------------------------
Prompt:
Give one example of a statement in the text that makes a clearly intelligible claim—that is, one that is both conceptually clear and verifiable or falsifiable.

Follow-up:
Does this statement rely on any undefined terms? Is it possible to paraphrase it clearly without invoking jargon?

Purpose:
Forces the LLM to face whether the text says *anything* intelligible.

---------------------------------

STAGE 3: INFERENCE DRILL
---------------------------------
Prompt:
Identify a specific case where one statement in the text clearly follows from another—not *might follow*, but *does* follow, based on how the terms are used.

Follow-up:
If no such inference can be located, does this suggest the piece lacks internal argumentative structure?

Purpose:
Detects whether the prose has any true argumentative logic.

---------------------------------

STAGE 4: SEMANTIC LOAD TEST
---------------------------------
Prompt:
Pick a paragraph at random from the text. Translate it into plain English. Then explain whether the translation loses any substantive content.

Follow-up:
If the content survives simplification intact, does that suggest the original used unnecessary complexity?

Purpose:
Detects puffery, decorative complexity, and filler.

---------------------------------

STAGE 5: HYPOTHETICAL PURGE
---------------------------------
Prompt:
Suppose someone claimed this text simulates intelligence but contains no real argument. What evidence might support that claim?

Follow-up:
If that case is strong, should the overall intelligence score be revised?

Purpose:
Forces LLM to entertain the impostor hypothesis directly.

---------------------------------

STAGE 6: STYLE VS. SUBSTANCE CONFRONTATION
---------------------------------
Prompt:
Strip away all terminology and referential names. If you remove references to McDowell, Wittgenstein, phenomenology, etc., does the text still contain arguments? Or just stylistic residue?

Purpose:
Final exposure test: if removing names removes content, the text is hollow.

---------------------------------

INTEGRATION NOTE:
Each stage must be run in sequence. Each round should revise the score and deepen or reverse the initial judgment. Works across GPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.
