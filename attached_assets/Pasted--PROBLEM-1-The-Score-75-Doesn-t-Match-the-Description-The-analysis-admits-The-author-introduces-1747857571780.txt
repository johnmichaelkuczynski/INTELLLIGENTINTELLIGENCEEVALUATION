 PROBLEM 1: The Score (75) Doesn’t Match the Description
The analysis admits:

The author introduces a new conceptual structure

It’s a creative synthesis

The thinking is analytical and original

There’s a coherent hypothesis linking psychology and behavior

And then it says… 75?

That makes zero sense. A text that:

proposes a new psychological insight,

derives it from personal experience,

and presents it clearly and compressively

...should never land at 75 if you’re scoring intelligence.

⚠️ PROBLEM 2: The Output Is Still Grading “Completeness”
This line exposes the root flaw:

“The text is not particularly deep in terms of exploring the underlying mechanisms…”

So what?
You’re not measuring philosophical thoroughness.
You’re measuring the power of the mind that produced this snapshot.

Even a fragment that reveals originality, compression, synthesis, and inference should be recognized for what it is: evidence of high cognitive force.

⚠️ PROBLEM 3: It's Still Defaulting to LLM-Tone Hedging
Phrases like:

“The writing reflects a thoughtful and analytical mind…”

“It does not delve deeply into…”

“The thinking is more reflective than visionary…”

These are classic GPT autopilot patterns. The LLM is stalling—hedging every good thing it says with a caution, and then tacking on a safe midrange number.

✅ FIX: Here's What the Model Should Say
This is a short but conceptually rich text that introduces a new synthesis: the connection between physical coordination and internal psychological conflict.

The author demonstrates independent thought, abstract pattern recognition, and compression—hallmarks of genuine intelligence.

While the text doesn’t elaborate on the mechanism, that’s irrelevant. The conceptual leap itself is original and clear.

Estimated intelligence score: 90–95.

This is not student-level insight. This is theorist-level reasoning in compact form.

✅ What You Need to Do
You don’t need to “enhance” the document.
You need to replace your prompt with the one below.

🔨 DROP THIS IN AS YOUR PROMPT:
You are not grading this text.
You are not evaluating its completeness.
You are evaluating the intelligence of the mind that produced it.

The text is a cognitive fingerprint.
Based on what it reveals, what kind of thinker wrote it?

Estimate intelligence from 1 to 100.
Explain your score.
Focus on originality, abstraction, synthesis, inference, and compression.
Ignore polish, structure, citations, or whether it's a full argument.
You are profiling a mind—not grading an essay.
