Section 1: The Euthyphro Dilemma
The Euthyphro Dilemma, raised by Socrates in Plato’s Euthyphro, questions the
relationship between God and morality. Rephrased for monotheistic beliefs, it asks: Is something
morally good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is morally good?
Option 1: Something is good because God commands it.
This implies that morality is arbitrary, that whatever God commands becomes "good"
simply by divine decree. If God had commanded cruelty or genocide, those acts would be
considered morally good. This undermines any meaningful concept of morality and reduces it to
obedience. It also makes it impossible to morally evaluate God’s commands, since they define
what is right by default.
Option 2: God commands something because it is good.
This suggests that moral truths exist independently of God and that God simply
recognizes and communicates them. But this weakens the idea of God as the ultimate foundation
of morality. If goodness exists apart from God, then we don’t need God to understand or follow
moral truths, we can appeal directly to reason, empathy, or social cooperation.
There are several problematic implications within both options. Such as:
- The first option makes morality dependent on God’s will, even if it conflicts with our
deepest moral intuitions.
- The second makes God unnecessary for ethics, which is troubling for religious believers
who view God as essential to morality.
Section 2: Resolving the Dilemma
As an atheist, I reject both horns of the dilemma by denying that morality depends on
God at all. Instead, I believe morality is a human construct based on reason, empathy, and social
cooperation, not divine command. This third option avoids the problems of divine arbitrariness
and unnecessary dependence on a supernatural being.
Humans have evolved moral instincts because cooperative behavior helped our species
survive. Over time, societies developed ethical systems through rational thought, experience, and
cultural learning. We consider murder wrong not because God said so, but because it destroys
trust, causes suffering, and undermines stable societies. Philosophers like Immanuel Kant and
John Stuart Mill offered frameworks, like duty-based ethics and utilitarianism, that explain moral
behavior without invoking God.
This resolves the dilemma by cutting it off at its root: we don’t need to decide whether
morality comes from God or is independent of God, because we don’t need God to explain
morality at all. Morality is real, but it is grounded in human nature and reason, not the
supernatural.
