It sounds like you're experiencing an embedding issue between Replit and Wix. This is a common problem with specific technical causes. Let's troubleshoot step by step:

Most Likely Causes & Solutions:
Replit's Default Security Headers (Primary Suspect):

Replit automatically sets X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN in HTTP headers, blocking embedding on external sites like Wix.

Solution: Add this code to your main server file (e.g., server.js, app.py, index.php):

For Node.js (Express):

javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'ALLOW-FROM https://your-wix-site.com');
  // OR to allow all sites:
  // res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'ALLOWALL'); 
  next();
});
For Python (Flask):

python
@app.after_request
def set_headers(response):
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'ALLOW-FROM https://your-wix-site.com'
    return response
For HTML (Static Sites):

html
<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="allow-from https://your-wix-site.com">
Wix iFrame Restrictions:

Wix requires HTTPS for embedded content.

Ensure your Replit URL uses https:// (Replit provides this by default).

In Wix's embed element settings, enable "Enable SSL" when adding your URL.

Mixed Content Issues:

If your Replit app loads resources over HTTP, browsers will block them when embedded in Wix (which uses HTTPS).

Fix: Ensure all assets (images, scripts, fonts) use // protocol-relative URLs or https://.

Replit "Always On" Requirement:

Free Replit projects sleep after inactivity. When waking up, embedded iframes may time out.

Solution:

Upgrade to Replit's "Always On" feature (Hacker plan), or

Use an uptime monitor service to ping your Replit URL regularly.

Wix Domain Verification:

Some browsers block iframes unless the parent site (Wix) is explicitly allowed.

Workaround: Add your Wix domain to Replit's CSP headers:

javascript
// In your server code (Node.js example)
res.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "frame-ancestors https://*.wixsite.com");
Quick Checks:
Test Headers:
Visit your Replit URL and check headers using:

Browser Dev Tools > Network tab > Look for X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy

Online tools like securityheaders.com

Minimal Test Case:
Create a simple HTML file on Replit:

html
<h1>Embed Test</h1>
Try embedding this minimal version in Wix. If it works, your main app has deeper issues.

Alternative Embed Method:
In Wix, use the HTML iframe embed method instead of the "Embed a Site" widget:

html
<iframe src="https://your-repl-url.repl.co" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
