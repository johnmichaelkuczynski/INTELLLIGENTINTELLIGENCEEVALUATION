HOW TO REBUILD THE CORE LOGIC (PERMANENT FIX)
Here’s a framework you can implement to reorient the app’s scoring away from “midwit simulation” and toward true analytical detection:

✅ A. REDESIGN THE PROMPT LOGIC TO FORCE DEEP EVALUATION
Instead of this:

“Evaluate the intelligence of this writing sample.”

Use this:

“Analyze whether this writing demonstrates authentic intelligence or merely simulates it. Distinguish between apparent intelligence and genuine conceptual insight. Specifically:

Identify whether each key term is defined, explained, and used to advance an argument.

Detect filler, circularity, or pseudo-academic scaffolding (e.g. repeating structure without necessity).

Determine whether claims are inferentially necessary or arbitrary.

Penalize statements that gesture at complexity without executing on it.
Your job is not to praise. Your job is to assess.”

✅ B. REWRITE THE CORE METRIC
Replace your existing dimensions like “surface complexity,” “semantic load,” or “depth fluency” with something more diagnostic.

Here's the new metric, with hard filters:

Dimension	Description	What to Reward	What to Penalize
Conceptual Integrity	Is each concept used clearly, consistently, and with real purpose?	Defined terms, real distinctions	Jargon-as-decoration, term-swapping
Inferential Necessity	Do claims lead to other claims? Are they necessary for the point being made?	Argument chains	Redundant, orphaned, or self-referential claims
Compression Fidelity	Does each sentence maximize meaning per word?	Dense, idea-rich phrasing	Padding, vague linkage phrases
Content Origination	Does the piece introduce insights not obviously borrowed or mimicked?	Creative framing, synthesis	Mimicry, generic academic phrasing
Impostor Index	Measure of sounding smart without saying anything	Low score = good	High score = detected simulation

✅ C. SET HARD GUARDS
If Impostor Index > 60%, cap all other scores at 70.
If Conceptual Integrity < 50, force Originality to ≤ 40.

This prevents puffery from slipping past just because it’s grammatically slick.

🛠 OPTIONAL: MIDWIT DETECTOR (SIDE MODULE)
You could add a fun diagnostic toggle:

“What would a midwit think of this?”

It would generate a meta-score simulating what a LinkedIn pseudo-intellectual, grad student, or AI model might rate as “brilliant.” This gives your app a mirror to contrast with the real evaluation.

TL;DR: YOUR APP IS TOO POLITE. MAKE IT RUTHLESS.
You're not measuring polish.
You're measuring mindfire.

Let me know if you want me to produce:

A copy/paste prompt for integration

A sample scoring rubric doc

A JSON scoring logic rewrite

Or even generate a few midwit samples for testing
