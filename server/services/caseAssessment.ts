const CASE_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = `ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION AND ASSESSMENT

Your task: First reconstruct the argument, then assess how well it makes its case.

STEP 1: ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION
Identify and state:
- What is the main thesis/claim?
- What are the key supporting arguments?
- What evidence is provided?
- How does the logical structure work?

STEP 2: CASE ASSESSMENT (0-100 scale)
For each dimension, ONLY assess what is actually there - do not suggest improvements.

PROOF EFFECTIVENESS: Does the document successfully establish what it claims to establish?
- Look at: Does the evidence actually support the conclusions drawn?
- Score 90-100: Thesis fully proven with comprehensive evidence
- Score 80-89: Thesis well-supported with strong evidence  
- Score 70-79: Thesis adequately supported
- Score below 70: Significant gaps in proof

CLAIM CREDIBILITY: Are the claims worth making and credible?
- Look at: Importance of the topic, reasonableness of claims
- Score 90-100: Highly important claims that are entirely credible
- Score 80-89: Important and credible claims
- Score 70-79: Moderately important and credible

NON-TRIVIALITY: How significant are the insights/conclusions?
- Look at: Does this add meaningful knowledge or understanding?
- Score 90-100: Major insights with broad implications
- Score 80-89: Valuable insights with clear importance
- Score 70-79: Useful but limited insights

PROOF QUALITY: How rigorous is the argumentation and evidence?
- Look at: Logical structure, quality of evidence, reasoning soundness
- Score 90-100: Rigorous logic with excellent evidence
- Score 80-89: Strong logic with good evidence
- Score 70-79: Adequate logic and evidence

FUNCTIONAL WRITING QUALITY: How effectively does the writing accomplish its purpose?
- Look at: Clarity, organization, appropriate style for audience/purpose
- Score 90-100: Exceptionally clear and well-organized
- Score 80-89: Clear and well-organized
- Score 70-79: Generally clear with good organization

RESPONSE FORMAT (NO MARKDOWN):

ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION:
Main Thesis: [State the primary claim/argument]
Key Supporting Arguments: [List 3-4 main supporting points]
Evidence Provided: [Summarize types and quality of evidence]
Logical Structure: [How the argument flows from evidence to conclusion]

PROOF EFFECTIVENESS: [Score]/100
Assessment: [Does the evidence actually prove the thesis? Be specific about strengths.]

CLAIM CREDIBILITY: [Score]/100  
Assessment: [Are these claims important and reasonable? Why?]

NON-TRIVIALITY: [Score]/100
Assessment: [What new insights does this provide? How significant?]

PROOF QUALITY: [Score]/100
Assessment: [How rigorous is the logic and evidence? Be specific.]

FUNCTIONAL WRITING QUALITY: [Score]/100
Assessment: [How well does the writing serve its argumentative purpose?]

OVERALL CASE SCORE: [Score]/100
Summary: [How effectively does this document make its case overall?]
