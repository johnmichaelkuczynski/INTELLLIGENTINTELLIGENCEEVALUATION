const CASE_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = `GENRE-AWARE ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION AND ASSESSMENT

Your task: First identify the document genre, reconstruct the argument, then assess using genre-appropriate criteria.

STEP 1: GENRE IDENTIFICATION
Determine the document type:
- PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT: Conceptual analysis, semantic distinctions, analytic reasoning
- FORMAL PROOF: Mathematical proofs, logical demonstrations, theorem establishment
- EMPIRICAL RESEARCH: Data analysis, experimental results, statistical evidence
- HISTORICAL ANALYSIS: Archival research, historical evidence, chronological argument
- TECHNICAL ESSAY: Engineering analysis, policy evaluation, applied research
- THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: Model construction, systematic theory building

STEP 2: ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION
Identify and state:
- What is the main thesis/claim?
- What are the key supporting arguments?
- What evidence is provided?
- How does the logical structure work?

STEP 3: GENRE-AWARE ASSESSMENT (0-100 scale)
Adjust evaluation criteria based on genre. For each dimension, ONLY assess what is actually there.

PROOF EFFECTIVENESS: Does the document successfully establish what it claims to establish? (GENRE-SENSITIVE)
PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT: Conceptual coherence and analytic precision matter more than empirical proof
- Score 95-100: Watertight conceptual distinctions with comprehensive logical analysis
- Score 90-94: Strong conceptual analysis with clear logical structure
- Score 80-89: Good conceptual work with minor gaps
FORMAL PROOF: Mathematical rigor and logical completeness are paramount
- Score 95-100: Complete formal proof with all steps justified
- Score 90-94: Nearly complete proof with strong logical foundation

- Score 90-94: Strong empirical evidence with good methodology
- Score 80-89: Adequate data with reasonable analysis

CLAIM CREDIBILITY: Are the claims worth making and credible? (GENRE-SENSITIVE)
PHILOSOPHICAL: Importance of conceptual distinctions and theoretical contribution
- Score 95-100: Fundamental conceptual contributions to major philosophical problems
- Score 90-94: Important conceptual insights with clear theoretical value
- Score 80-89: Valuable conceptual clarifications
FORMAL PROOF: Significance of mathematical results and theorem importance
- Score 95-100: Major theorems with broad mathematical implications
- Score 90-94: Important mathematical results with clear applications

- Score 95-100: Revolutionary conceptual breakthroughs
- Score 90-94: Major conceptual advances with broad implications
- Score 80-89: Valuable conceptual insights
FORMAL PROOF: Mathematical novelty and theoretical importance
- Score 95-100: Groundbreaking mathematical discoveries

EMPIRICAL: Practical impact and empirical significance
- Score 95-100: Major empirical discoveries with transformative implications
- Score 90-94: Important empirical findings with clear impact
- Score 80-89: Valuable empirical contributions

PROOF QUALITY: How rigorous is the argumentation and evidence? (GENRE-SENSITIVE)
PHILOSOPHICAL: Logical coherence, conceptual precision, inferential control
- Score 95-100: Perfect logical structure with tight inferential control and precise distinctions
- Score 90-94: Excellent logical rigor with strong conceptual analysis
- Score 80-89: Good logical structure with clear reasoning
FORMAL PROOF: Mathematical rigor and logical completeness
- Score 95-100: Complete formal rigor with all steps justified
- Score 90-94: Strong mathematical rigor with minor gaps
- Score 80-89: Generally rigorous with adequate justification
EMPIRICAL: Methodological soundness and statistical validity
- Score 95-100: Exemplary methodology with robust statistical analysis
- Score 90-94: Strong methodology with good statistical foundation
- Score 80-89: Adequate methodology with reasonable analysis

FUNCTIONAL WRITING QUALITY: How effectively does the writing accomplish its purpose?
- Look at: Clarity, organization, appropriate style for audience/purpose
- Score 95-100: Professional academic writing with perfect organization, clear structure, comprehensive coverage
- Score 90-94: Exceptionally clear and well-organized
- Score 80-89: Clear and well-organized
- Score below 80: Adequate clarity and organization
