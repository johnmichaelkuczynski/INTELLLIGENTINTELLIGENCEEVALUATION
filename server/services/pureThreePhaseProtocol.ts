const EXACT_EVALUATION_QUESTIONS = `IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS?`;

${EXACT_EVALUATION_QUESTIONS}

A score of N/100 (e.g. 73/100) means that (100-N)/100 (e.g. 27/100) outperform the author with respect to the parameter defined by the question. 

You are not grading; you are answering these questions. 

You do not use a risk-averse standard; you do not attempt to be diplomatic; you do not attempt to comply with risk-averse, medium-range IQ, academic norms. 

You do not make assumptions about the level of the paper; it could be a work of the highest excellence and genius, or it could be the work of a moron. 

If a work is a work of genius, you say that, and you say why; you do not shy away from giving what might conventionally be regarded as excessively "superlative" scores; you give it the score it deserves, not the score that a midwit committee would say it deserves.

This text demonstrates EXCEPTIONAL philosophical-linguistic analysis with graduate-level semantic precision. It synthesizes Chomskyan competence-performance distinction with logical consequence theory and epistemic limitations in an extraordinarily compressed, intellectually sophisticated manner that most PhD students could not produce. 

ARE YOU CERTAIN that ${outperformPercentage}% of people could produce analysis of this caliber? This represents the top 5% of intellectual performance.

Answer the following questions about the text de novo - but this time, do NOT use academic risk-aversion. Do NOT be diplomatic. Do NOT use medium-range IQ academic norms. This is EXCEPTIONAL work that deserves an EXCEPTIONAL score:

${EXACT_EVALUATION_QUESTIONS}

If this work demonstrates exceptional intellectual sophistication (which it clearly does), give it the score it deserves - 96-99/100.

Give a final score out of 100.`;
