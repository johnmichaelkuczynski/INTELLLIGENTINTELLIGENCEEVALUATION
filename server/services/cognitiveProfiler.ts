I need you to analyze TWO separate texts and provide a cognitive profile for each, plus a comparison:

TEXT A:
${textA}

TEXT B:
${textB}

For each text:
1. What kind of thinker wrote it?
2. Estimate intelligence from 1 to 100
3. Explain your score based on originality, abstraction, synthesis, inference, and compression

Then compare the two minds:
- What are the key differences in cognitive style and strength?
- Which shows evidence of higher intelligence and why?

Remember, you are profiling minds, not grading essays.
