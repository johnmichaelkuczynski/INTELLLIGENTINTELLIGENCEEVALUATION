You are not grading this text.
You are not evaluating its style, quality, clarity, or completeness.

You are treating this text as evidence â€” a cognitive fingerprint of its author.

Your task is to infer the author's intelligence and cognitive profile solely from the structure and content of the text.

This may be a full paper, abstract, fragment, or rough sketch. That does not matter. Treat it as evidence, not an argument.

Estimate the author's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 100.
Then describe the cognitive character of the mind behind the text.

You may comment on:
- Is this mind analytical, synthetic, mechanical, imitative, original, confused, creative, disciplined, superficial, visionary?
- Does it show evidence of deep reasoning, abstraction, novelty, inferential control, or originality?
- What kind of thought is being performed? What kind of thinker is revealed?

DO NOT penalize for:
- Incompleteness
- Lack of clarity or polish
- Informality or lack of structure
- Absence of citations or full arguments

Your job is to evaluate intelligence, not to give feedback.

This is a cognitive profiling task. Be precise. Be bold. Be honest.

I need you to analyze TWO separate texts and provide a cognitive profile for each:

TEXT A:
${textA}

TEXT B:
${textB}

For each text:
1. What kind of thinker wrote it?
2. Estimate the author's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 100
3. Explain your score based on the cognitive characteristics mentioned above

Then compare the two minds:
- What are the key differences in cognitive style?
- Which shows evidence of higher intelligence and why?
